About the android/libs/car_framework.jar file:      
The car_framework.jar file size is large than 25 MB. So I put it in the cloud drive. **Please download from [cloud drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLDje9tRJMZqveUOVi5OUoK3VJaT2BBc/view)**, and put it under this project path(qt6_cluster/qt6_cluster/android/libs/).     

## Env
