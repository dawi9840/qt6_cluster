# qt6_cluster
Update Qt5 language to Qt6 version with Cluster. The Qt Creator compile is fit for Qt 6 version.   

About the android/libs/car_framework.jar file:      
The car_framework.jar file size is large than 25 MB. So I put it in the cloud drive. **Please download from [cloud drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLDje9tRJMZqveUOVi5OUoK3VJaT2BBc/view)**, and put it under this project path(qt6_cluster/qt6_cluster/android/libs/).     

## Env   
Qt Creator compile:   
- Android Qt 6.2.8 Clang arm64-v8a   
- Android Qt 6.5.0 Clang arm64-v8a
